# Task: Backend Foundation Setup

## Overview

Establish the core FastAPI backend foundation with async database connections, PostgreSQL schema design, Redis caching, JWT authentication system, and basic project structure. This task provides the essential backend infrastructure that all other services will build upon.

## Technical Requirements

### FastAPI Project Setup
- FastAPI application with async/await patterns optimized for high concurrency
- Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async database sessions and connection pooling
- Alembic migrations for database schema versioning and deployment
- Environment-based configuration management with Pydantic Settings

### PostgreSQL Schema Design
- Multi-tenant database architecture supporting multiple school districts
- Optimized table structure for users, classes, attendance records with proper indexing
- Foreign key relationships with cascading deletes and referential integrity
- Performance-optimized indexes for common query patterns (attendance by date, class joins)
- FERPA-compliant audit trails with automated timestamp and user tracking

### Redis Caching Layer
- Session management and JWT token blacklisting with configurable TTL
- Real-time attendance state caching for WebSocket updates
- QR code validation tokens with automatic expiration
- Rate limiting counters and API throttling data
- Background job queue integration for async task processing

### JWT Authentication System
- Secure JWT implementation with RS256 signing and refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for teachers, students, administrators
- Token expiration handling with automatic refresh workflows
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with proper salt rounds
- SSO integration preparation with modular authentication providers

### Project Structure & Configuration
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns (routes, services, models, utils)
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds for development and production
- Comprehensive environment configuration for database, Redis, JWT secrets
- Health check endpoints for monitoring and deployment validation
- Logging configuration with structured JSON output for production monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Infrastructure
- [ ] FastAPI application starts successfully with all dependencies configured
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection established with async SQLAlchemy 2.0+ sessions
- [ ] Redis connection tested with cache read/write operations
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for local development environment
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured and validated on startup

### Database Schema
- [ ] All core tables created via Alembic migrations (users, schools, classes, attendance)
- [ ] Foreign key relationships established with proper constraints
- [ ] Database indexes created for performance optimization
- [ ] Audit trail tables created for FERPA compliance tracking
- [ ] Sample data seeding script for development and testing

### Authentication System
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation working correctly
- [ ] User registration and login endpoints implemented
- [ ] Password hashing and verification secure and tested
- [ ] Refresh token rotation mechanism implemented
- [ ] Role-based access control middleware functioning

### Caching & Performance
- [ ] Redis connection pool configured with proper timeout settings
- [ ] Session storage and retrieval working via Redis
- [ ] Basic caching decorators implemented for database queries
- [ ] Health check endpoints returning proper status codes
- [ ] Application startup time under 5 seconds in development

### Development Experience
- [ ] Hot reload working for development workflow
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] API documentation auto-generated via FastAPI/OpenAPI
- [ ] Basic logging configured with appropriate levels
- [ ] Code linting and formatting configured (black, flake8, mypy)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
```python
# Core entities that must be implemented
- User (teachers, students, administrators)
- School (multi-tenant support)
- Class (course instances)
- Attendance (attendance records)
- AuditLog (FERPA compliance)
```

### API Endpoints
```python
# Essential endpoints that must be created
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/refresh
- GET /health
- GET /docs (auto-generated)
```

### Configuration Structure
```python
# Environment variables that must be configured
- DATABASE_URL
- REDIS_URL
- JWT_SECRET_KEY
- JWT_ALGORITHM
- JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Database connection and session management tested
- [ ] User authentication flows covered with positive and negative cases
- [ ] JWT token generation, validation, and expiration scenarios tested
- [ ] Redis caching operations tested with proper error handling
- [ ] Configuration loading and validation tested

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full database migration and rollback tested
- [ ] Redis connection resilience tested with service interruptions
- [ ] Authentication endpoints tested end-to-end
- [ ] Health check endpoints tested under various system states
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation verified

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Database connection pool performance under concurrent load
- [ ] JWT token operations benchmarked for acceptable latency
- [ ] Redis operations tested for sub-millisecond response times
- [ ] Application startup time measured and optimized
- [ ] Memory usage profiled and optimized for production

## Documentation Deliverables

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Database schema diagram with relationship documentation
- [ ] API endpoint documentation with request/response examples
- [ ] Environment setup guide for development and production
- [ ] Authentication flow documentation with security considerations
- [ ] Deployment guide with Docker and database setup instructions

### Development Guidelines
- [ ] Code style guide and linting configuration
- [ ] Testing strategy and coverage requirements
- [ ] Git workflow and branch naming conventions
- [ ] Security best practices for handling sensitive data
- [ ] Performance optimization guidelines and benchmarks

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- PostgreSQL 14+ server with database created
- Redis 6+ server for caching and session management
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- SSL certificates for HTTPS in production environment

### Internal Dependencies
- None (this is a foundational task that can run in parallel)

### Development Environment
- Python 3.11+ with virtual environment management
- IDE/editor with Python language server and linting support
- Database administration tool (pgAdmin, TablePlus, or CLI tools)
- Redis CLI or GUI tool for cache inspection and debugging

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement connection pooling and query optimization from start
- **Authentication Security**: Use established libraries (passlib, python-jose) rather than custom implementation
- **Configuration Management**: Validate all environment variables on startup with clear error messages
- **Memory Leaks**: Implement proper async context management for database sessions

### Operational Risks
- **Local Development Setup**: Provide comprehensive Docker Compose setup for consistent environments
- **Database Migration Issues**: Test migrations thoroughly with rollback procedures documented
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Pin all dependency versions and maintain security update schedule
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Implement monitoring and profiling from development stage

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Application startup time: <5 seconds
- Database query response time: <100ms for simple queries
- JWT token operations: <10ms per operation
- Redis cache operations: <1ms per operation
- Memory usage: <200MB for base application

### Quality Gates
- Code coverage: >90% for core authentication and database modules
- No high-severity security vulnerabilities in dependency scan
- All type hints properly configured with mypy validation passing
- Docker image size optimized to <500MB for production
- All environment configurations documented and validated
