- POST /attendance/join/code (manual code entry join)
- GET /attendance/session/{token}/validate (session validation)
- POST /attendance/offline-sync (batch sync for offline joins)
```

### Camera API Implementation
```javascript
// Camera API features that must be implemented
- navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() integration
- Real-time video stream processing for QR detection
- Camera permission request handling and error states
