# Issue #12 Analysis: Integrate WebSocket with Attendance APIs

## Work Stream Analysis

This task has 3 parallel work streams:

### Stream A: Attendance API WebSocket Integration (Core Integration)
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `backend/app/api/v1/attendance.py`
**Scope**: 
- Add WebSocket broadcast calls after successful attendance POST operations
- Implement attendance_created and attendance_updated message types
- Add error handling for WebSocket broadcast failures
- Ensure broadcasts don't affect REST API performance

### Stream B: Class Verification Enhancement (User Experience)
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `backend/app/api/v1/classes.py` 
**Scope**:
- Enhance verification code validation with real-time feedback
- Implement student_joined_class message type
- Add WebSocket broadcasts for successful class joining
- Improve error messaging for verification failures

### Stream C: WebSocket Message Schema (Data Structure)
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `backend/app/schemas/attendance.py`, `backend/app/core/websocket.py`
**Scope**:
- Define WebSocket message schemas for attendance updates
- Implement attendance_state_changed general message type
- Ensure proper data serialization for client consumption
- Add authorization checks for attendance update messages

## Dependencies
- Stream A can start immediately (depends on Task #11 which is complete)
- Stream B can run in parallel with Stream A
- Stream C should coordinate with both A and B for consistent message formats

## Coordination Notes
- All streams integrate with WebSocket infrastructure from Task #11
- Streams A and B need consistent message format (coordinate with Stream C)
- No direct file conflicts, but message format coordination required

## Estimated Effort
- Stream A: 2.5 hours (core API integration)  
- Stream B: 2 hours (verification enhancement)
- Stream C: 1.5 hours (schema definition and coordination)
- Total: 6 hours (can be done mostly in parallel with coordination)
