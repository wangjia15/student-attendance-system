## Overview
Optimize database performance for attendance-related operations by adding strategic indexes and implementing optimistic locking to handle concurrent attendance record updates. This ensures the system can handle multiple simultaneous check-ins/check-outs without data corruption.

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- `backend/app/models/attendance.py` - Add optimistic locking field and constraints
- `backend/app/models/class_session.py` - Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- `backend/alembic/versions/` - Create new migration for indexes and schema changes
- `backend/app/api/v1/attendance.py` - Add race condition error handling
- `backend/app/services/attendance.py` - Implement optimistic locking logic (if service layer exists)

### Database Optimizations
1. Add composite indexes on attendance table:
   - `(class_session_id, student_id)` - Primary lookup pattern
   - `(class_session_id, check_in_time)` - Time-based queries
   - `(student_id, created_at)` - Student attendance history
2. Add version field to attendance model for optimistic locking
3. Add database constraints for data integrity

### Implementation Steps
1. Add version field to Attendance model
2. Create database migration for new indexes and version field
3. Implement optimistic locking in attendance update operations
4. Add proper error handling for race conditions (HTTP 409 Conflict)
5. Add retry logic for failed concurrent updates
6. Test concurrent update scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database indexes are created for frequently queried attendance data
- [ ] Optimistic locking prevents concurrent update conflicts
- [ ] Race condition errors return appropriate HTTP 409 status
- [ ] Database migration runs successfully without data loss
- [ ] Query performance is measurably improved for attendance lookups
- [ ] Concurrent attendance updates are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly for conflict scenarios
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API contracts

## Dependencies
None - This task can run in parallel with frontend work as it focuses on backend database optimizations.

## Notes
This task focuses on backend performance and data integrity. It can be implemented independently of the WebSocket tasks since it deals with the data layer rather than the communication layer.
