# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #13

## Overview
Optimize database performance for attendance-related operations by adding strategic indexes and implementing optimistic locking to handle concurrent attendance record updates. This ensures the system can handle multiple simultaneous check-ins/check-outs without data corruption.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Database Schema & Migration
**Scope**: Database model changes, migration creation, and index implementation
**Files**:
- `backend/app/models/attendance.py`
- `backend/app/models/class_session.py`
- `backend/alembic/versions/*` (new migration file)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Service Layer & API Updates
**Scope**: Optimistic locking logic, race condition handling, and API error responses
**Files**:
- `backend/app/services/attendance.py`
- `backend/app/api/v1/attendance.py`
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes model changes
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs version field in models)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
No files are shared between streams, ensuring clean separation.

### Sequential Requirements
1. Database models must be updated before service layer can implement optimistic locking
2. Migration must be created after model changes are complete
3. API layer updates should happen after service layer implementation

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different layers with clear dependencies
- Model changes happen first, then service/API layer builds on them
- No overlapping file modifications

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Sequential with some parallel potential

**Implementation Plan**: 
1. Start Stream A (database changes) immediately
2. Begin Stream B after Stream A completes model updates but can run parallel with migration creation
3. This allows some overlap while maintaining proper dependencies

## Expected Timeline

With sequential execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours
- Total work: 4 hours

With optimized execution:
- Wall time: 2.5 hours (some overlap possible)
- Total work: 4 hours
- Efficiency gain: 37.5%

## Notes
- Focus on one stream at a time initially due to strong dependencies
- Once model changes are complete, service/API work can proceed independently
- Migration testing should be done carefully to ensure no data loss
- Consider testing concurrent scenarios thoroughly after implementation
