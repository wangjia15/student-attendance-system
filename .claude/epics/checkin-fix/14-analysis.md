# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #14

## Overview
Update frontend WebSocket integration to use class-specific endpoints `/ws/attendance/{class_id}` and implement robust connection management with status indicators, automatic reconnection, and proper state management.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: WebSocket Service & State Management
**Scope**: Core WebSocket connection logic, Zustand store updates, and connection management
**Files**:
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- `frontend/src/store/attendanceStore.ts`  
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: UI Components & Connection Status
**Scope**: AttendanceDashboard UI updates, connection indicators, and user experience elements
**Files**:
- `frontend/src/components/AttendanceDashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/AttendanceDashboard.css`
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A establishes connection state interface
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs WebSocket connection state structure)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Interfaces
- WebSocket connection state structure (connecting, connected, disconnected, error)
- Connection status props interface for UI components
- Class-specific connection management patterns

### Sequential Requirements
1. WebSocket service and state management must be implemented first
2. UI components need the connection state interface to display status
3. Both streams should coordinate on error handling patterns

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different layers (service vs UI)
- Connection state interface acts as clean boundary between streams
- No overlapping file modifications

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Sequential start with overlap potential

**Implementation Plan**: 
1. Start Stream A (WebSocket service) immediately  
2. Begin Stream B after Stream A defines connection state interface
3. Allow parallel completion of both streams once interfaces are established

## Expected Timeline

With sequential execution:
- Wall time: 5 hours
- Total work: 5 hours

With optimized execution:
- Wall time: 3.5 hours (parallel completion after interface definition)
- Total work: 5 hours  
- Efficiency gain: 30%

## Notes
- Focus on Stream A first to establish connection patterns
- Stream B can start once connection state interface is defined
- Test coordination needed for class-specific endpoint integration
- Consider backend task 13 dependencies for endpoint compatibility
