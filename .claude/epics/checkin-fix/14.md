## Description

Update the frontend WebSocket integration to align with the new class-specific endpoint structure and improve connection reliability. The WebSocket connection URL needs to be updated from `/ws/attendance` to `/ws/attendance/{class_id}`, and robust connection management features need to be implemented.

## Technical Requirements

### WebSocket URL Updates
- Update WebSocket connection URL from `/ws/attendance` to `/ws/attendance/{class_id}`
- Implement dynamic URL construction based on active class context
- Ensure proper URL encoding for class_id parameter

### Connection Management
- Add connection status indicators to AttendanceDashboard component
- Implement automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Add comprehensive error handling for WebSocket connection failures
- Handle network interruptions and server unavailability gracefully

### State Management Updates
- Update Zustand store to manage class-specific WebSocket connections
- Implement connection pooling for multiple concurrent class sessions
- Add WebSocket connection state to global store (connecting, connected, disconnected, error)
- Handle cleanup when switching between classes or logging out

### Component Integration
- Integrate connection status UI elements into AttendanceDashboard
- Show real-time connection indicators (connected, reconnecting, disconnected)
- Display user-friendly error messages for connection issues
- Implement loading states during connection establishment

## Files to Modify

### Frontend Components
- `frontend/src/components/AttendanceDashboard.tsx` - Add connection status UI
- `frontend/src/components/AttendanceDashboard.css` - Style connection indicators
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Update WebSocket connection logic
- `frontend/src/store/attendanceStore.ts` - Add WebSocket state management
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Implement connection management hooks

### WebSocket Service
- Create or update WebSocket service with class-specific connection handling
- Implement reconnection logic and error recovery
- Add connection event listeners and state management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Connection Management
- [ ] WebSocket connects to `/ws/attendance/{class_id}` endpoint successfully
- [ ] Connection status is visually indicated in AttendanceDashboard UI
- [ ] Automatic reconnection occurs after network interruptions
- [ ] Connection errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Multiple class sessions can maintain separate WebSocket connections

### User Experience
- [ ] Connection indicators show current status (connected/connecting/disconnected)
- [ ] Loading states are displayed during connection establishment
- [ ] Error messages provide actionable guidance for connection issues
- [ ] Reconnection attempts are transparent to the user
- [ ] Connection cleanup occurs properly when switching classes or logging out

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Zustand store manages WebSocket connection state correctly
- [ ] Connection pooling works for multiple concurrent sessions
- [ ] WebSocket cleanup prevents memory leaks
- [ ] Error boundaries handle WebSocket-related failures
- [ ] Connection state persists appropriately across component re-renders

### Integration Testing
- [ ] WebSocket connections work with updated backend endpoints
- [ ] Real-time attendance updates are received correctly
- [ ] Connection recovery works after server restarts
- [ ] Multiple teachers can maintain separate connections simultaneously
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with multiple active connections

## Definition of Done

- All WebSocket connections use class-specific URLs
- Connection status is visually represented in the UI
- Automatic reconnection works reliably
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- Zustand store properly manages connection state
- No memory leaks from WebSocket connections
- Integration tests pass with new WebSocket structure
- Documentation updated for WebSocket connection patterns

## Notes

- This task runs in parallel with Task 13 (Backend WebSocket Updates)
- Coordinate with backend changes to ensure endpoint compatibility
- Consider offline scenarios and graceful degradation
- Test thoroughly with multiple concurrent class sessions
- Ensure connection cleanup prevents resource leaks
