# Issue #11 Analysis: Enable Production WebSocket Server

## Work Stream Analysis

This task has 2 parallel work streams:

### Stream A: WebSocket Server Configuration (Backend Core)
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `backend/main.py`
**Scope**: 
- Uncomment WebSocket server setup (~15 lines)
- Enable production WebSocket infrastructure
- Verify server startup integration

### Stream B: WebSocket Route Implementation (API Layer)  
**Agent**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `backend/app/core/websocket.py`, potential new route files
**Scope**:
- Add `/ws/attendance/{class_id}` route  
- Implement connection handling with existing attendance_ws_manager
- Add connection authentication/authorization
- Ensure proper lifecycle management

## Dependencies
- Stream A must complete before Stream B can test the routes
- Stream B can start implementation while Stream A is in progress

## Coordination Notes
- Both streams work on backend code but different files
- Stream A enables infrastructure, Stream B adds the specific routes
- No file conflicts expected

## Estimated Effort
- Stream A: 1.5 hours (uncomment and configure)  
- Stream B: 2.5 hours (route implementation and testing)
- Total: 4 hours (can be done in parallel with coordination)
