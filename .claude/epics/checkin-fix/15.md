## Description

Clarify and separate the student enrollment and daily check-in workflows in the StudentDashboard to eliminate user confusion. Currently, the UI conflates one-time class enrollment with daily attendance check-in, leading to unclear user interactions and potential data inconsistencies.

## Technical Requirements

### UI Flow Separation
- Clearly distinguish between "Join Class" (one-time enrollment) and "Check In" (daily attendance)
- Create separate interface sections for enrollment vs daily check-in actions
- Implement conditional rendering based on student's enrollment status in each class
- Add clear visual indicators for enrollment status vs daily attendance status

### StudentDashboard Restructuring
- Separate enrollment interface from attendance check-in interface
- Show enrolled classes in a dedicated section with daily check-in options
- Display available classes for enrollment in a separate section
- Implement tabbed or sectioned layout to organize different actions

### State Management Updates
- Update Zustand store to track enrollment status separately from daily attendance
- Implement separate actions for enrollment and check-in operations
- Add loading states for both enrollment and check-in processes
- Handle error states distinctly for each operation type

### Feedback and Messaging
- Provide clear success/error feedback for enrollment actions
- Provide clear success/error feedback for daily check-in actions
- Show different messaging for enrollment vs attendance operations
- Display contextual help text to guide users through proper workflows

## Files to Modify

### React Components
- `frontend/src/components/StudentDashboard.tsx` - Major restructuring for flow separation
- `frontend/src/components/StudentDashboard.css` - New styles for separated interfaces
- `frontend/src/types/api.ts` - Add enrollment status types if needed
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Ensure clear API calls for enrollment vs check-in

### State Management
- `frontend/src/store/attendanceStore.ts` - Separate enrollment and attendance state
- Add enrollment status tracking and management
- Implement separate actions for enrollment and daily check-in

### UI Components (if needed)
- Create `EnrollmentSection.tsx` component for class enrollment interface
- Create `CheckInSection.tsx` component for daily attendance interface
- Update existing components to use new separated logic

## Acceptance Criteria

### UI Clarity and Organization
- [ ] "Join Class" and "Check In" actions are visually and functionally distinct
- [ ] Enrolled classes are displayed in a separate section from available classes
- [ ] UI clearly shows which classes student is enrolled in vs available for enrollment
- [ ] Daily attendance status is distinct from enrollment status in the interface
- [ ] Interface adapts appropriately based on student's enrollment state

### User Experience Flow
- [ ] Students can easily identify classes they need to enroll in
- [ ] Students can easily perform daily check-in for enrolled classes
- [ ] Clear visual feedback is provided for both enrollment and check-in actions
- [ ] Error messages are specific to the operation being performed
- [ ] Success confirmations are clear and operation-specific

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Enrollment process works independently from daily check-in
- [ ] Daily check-in is only available for enrolled classes
- [ ] Students cannot check in to classes they haven't enrolled in
- [ ] Enrollment status persists correctly across browser sessions
- [ ] Real-time updates reflect both enrollment and attendance changes

### State Management
- [ ] Zustand store correctly tracks enrollment status separately from daily attendance
- [ ] Loading states work appropriately for both enrollment and check-in operations
- [ ] Error states are handled distinctly for each operation type
- [ ] State updates don't interfere between enrollment and attendance actions

### Integration and Performance
- [ ] API calls are optimized and don't duplicate requests
- [ ] Component re-renders are minimized during state updates
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket updates work for both enrollment and attendance events
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with large numbers of available classes
- [ ] Offline scenarios are handled gracefully for both workflows

## Definition of Done

- StudentDashboard clearly separates enrollment and check-in interfaces
- Users can easily distinguish between joining a class and checking in
- Enrollment status and daily attendance status are tracked independently
- Success/error feedback is specific to each operation type
- State management correctly handles both enrollment and attendance operations
- Real-time updates work for both types of operations
- User testing confirms improved clarity and reduced confusion
- All integration tests pass with separated workflows

## Notes

- This task depends on Task 12 (API endpoint separation) being completed first
- Can run in parallel with other tasks after API changes are implemented
- Focus on user experience and interface clarity
- Consider mobile-first design principles for touch interactions
- Test thoroughly with both enrolled and non-enrolled student scenarios
- Ensure backwards compatibility with existing data structures
