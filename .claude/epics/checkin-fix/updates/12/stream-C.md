# Stream C: WebSocket Message Schema

## Scope
Define WebSocket message schemas for attendance updates, implement attendance_state_changed general message type, ensure proper data serialization and add authorization checks.

## Files
- backend/app/schemas/attendance.py
- backend/app/core/websocket.py

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: Added comprehensive WebSocket message schemas to attendance.py
- ✅ COMPLETED: Implemented AttendanceCreatedMessage for new attendance records
- ✅ COMPLETED: Implemented AttendanceUpdatedMessage for modified attendance records  
- ✅ COMPLETED: Implemented StudentJoinedClassMessage for successful class joining
- ✅ COMPLETED: Implemented AttendanceStateChangedMessage (general message type)
- ✅ COMPLETED: Added BulkAttendanceUpdateMessage for bulk operations
- ✅ COMPLETED: Added AttendanceStatsUpdateMessage for statistics updates
- ✅ COMPLETED: Extended MessageType enum in websocket.py with all required message types
- ✅ COMPLETED: Added dedicated broadcasting methods for each attendance message type
- ✅ COMPLETED: Implemented proper data serialization with Pydantic schemas
- ✅ COMPLETED: Added WebSocketAuthContext and authorize_attendance_message function
- ✅ COMPLETED: Authorization checks ensure students only see their own attendance data
- ✅ COMPLETED: Teachers can see all attendance updates for their classes
- ✅ COMPLETED: Provided consistent message format foundation for Streams A and B

## Implementation Details
- All message schemas inherit from WebSocketMessageBase for consistency
- Each message type has specific fields relevant to its purpose
- Authorization function supports role-based access (teacher, student, admin)
- Broadcasting methods are ready for API integration by other streams
- Proper timestamp and class_id routing support for real-time updates

## Integration Notes for Other Streams
- Stream A (attendance.py API): Use broadcast_attendance_created/updated methods
- Stream B (classes.py API): Use broadcast_student_joined_class method
- All messages include proper data serialization and authorization context
- Message types are available in MessageType enum for consistent usage
