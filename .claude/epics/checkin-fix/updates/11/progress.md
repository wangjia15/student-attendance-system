   - Uncommented and configured ~15 lines of WebSocket server components

2. **Stream B: WebSocket Route Implementation** ✅

   - Integrated with existing attendance_ws_manager
   - Comprehensive test suite created and passing

### All Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ WebSocket server is enabled and running in main.py
- ✅ `/ws/attendance/{class_id}` endpoint is accessible
- ✅ WebSocket connections can be established to specific class attendance channels
- ✅ Connection authentication verifies user access to the specified class
- ✅ Proper connection cleanup on disconnect
- ✅ WebSocket manager properly handles multiple concurrent connections per class
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing REST API functionality

### Foundation Ready
WebSocket infrastructure is now enabled for dependent tasks #12, #14, and other real-time features.
