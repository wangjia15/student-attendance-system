# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #4

## Overview
Develop a mobile-optimized class creation system with secure QR codes, shareable links, 6-digit verification codes, and real-time monitoring. The system enables teachers to create attendance sessions in under 15 seconds with comprehensive security and deep linking support.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Backend API & Security Layer
**Scope**: Core API endpoints, JWT security, session management, WebSocket infrastructure
**Files**:
- `src/api/classes.py` (new)
- `src/models/class_session.py` (new)
- `src/security/jwt_tokens.py` (new)
- `src/websocket/live_updates.py` (new)
- `src/services/qr_generator.py` (new)
- `src/services/verification_codes.py` (new)
**Agent Type**: backend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream B: Frontend Core Components
**Scope**: Mobile-optimized class creation form, QR code display, verification code interface
**Files**:
- `src/components/ClassCreationForm.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/QRCodeGenerator.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/VerificationCodeDisplay.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ShareLinkManager.tsx` (new)
- `src/styles/mobile-optimized.css` (new)
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 3
**Dependencies**: none

### Stream C: Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
**Scope**: WebSocket integration, attendance dashboard, live updates interface
**Files**:
- `src/components/AttendanceDashboard.tsx` (new)
- `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` (new)
- `src/services/realtime.ts` (new)
- `src/components/StudentJoinNotification.tsx` (new)
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream A completes WebSocket endpoints
**Estimated Hours**: 2.5
**Dependencies**: Stream A (WebSocket infrastructure)

### Stream D: PWA & Deep Linking Integration
**Scope**: Progressive Web App setup, deep linking configuration, social sharing
**Files**:
- `public/manifest.json` (new)
- `src/utils/deepLinking.ts` (new)
- `src/services/socialSharing.ts` (new)
- `public/sw.js` (service worker, new)
- `src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx` (new)
**Agent Type**: frontend-specialist
**Can Start**: after Stream B completes core components
**Estimated Hours**: 2
**Dependencies**: Stream B (core components)

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
Limited overlap, well-separated concerns:
- `src/types/api.ts` - Streams A & B (coordinate API type definitions)
- `package.json` - Stream A (backend deps), Stream B/D (frontend deps)
- `src/config/constants.ts` - All streams (shared configuration)

### Sequential Requirements
1. Backend API endpoints (Stream A) before real-time monitoring (Stream C)
2. Core components (Stream B) before PWA integration (Stream D)
3. JWT security setup before QR code generation
4. WebSocket infrastructure before live updates

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams work on different component areas and API layers
- **Medium Risk**: Type definitions will need coordination between frontend/backend
- **Low Risk**: Configuration files have minimal overlap

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A & B simultaneously (backend + core frontend). Stream C starts when A completes WebSocket endpoints. Stream D starts when B completes core components. This maximizes parallelization while respecting dependencies.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Wall time: 4 hours (longest stream duration)
- Total work: 11.5 hours
- Efficiency gain: 65%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 11.5 hours

**Execution Plan:**
- Hours 0-4: Streams A & B work in parallel
- Hour 3: Stream C starts (depends on A's WebSocket completion)
- Hour 3: Stream D starts (depends on B's core components)
- Hour 4: All streams converge for integration testing

## Notes
- Stream A should prioritize WebSocket infrastructure early to unblock Stream C
- Stream B should focus on core components first to enable Stream D
- Type definitions should be established early by Stream A to avoid frontend conflicts
- Mobile testing requires device setup and SSL certificates for PWA functionality
- Security implementation is critical - Stream A should complete JWT/token security before other streams integrate
