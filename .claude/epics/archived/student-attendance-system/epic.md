# Epic: Student Attendance System

## Overview

A mobile-first student attendance tracking system built with FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend, featuring instant face-to-face class creation and multiple student join methods. The system enables teachers to create classes in <15 seconds and students to join via QR codes, shareable links, or 6-digit verification codes, with self-check-in completing attendance in <30 seconds total.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Mobile-First PWA**: Next.js with service workers for offline capability, targeting smartphones as primary device
- **Microservices Backend**: FastAPI with async/await patterns for high-performance concurrent operations
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for live attendance updates and join monitoring
- **Component-Based UI**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives for accessibility and consistency
- **Multi-Tenant Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching for scalable multi-district support
- **Security-First Design**: JWT with refresh tokens, time-limited QR codes, FERPA-compliant audit trails

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Instant Class Creation UI**: Mobile-optimized form with minimal data entry (<15 second target)
- **Multi-Join Interface**: QR scanner, link handler, and code entry with unified UX
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live student join monitoring with WebSocket updates
- **Attendance Management**: Touch-optimized self-check-in with teacher override capabilities
- **PWA Shell**: Service worker, offline sync, push notifications, camera API integration

### Backend Services
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control and SSO integration
- **Class Management Service**: CRUD operations for classes with instant creation optimization
- **Attendance Service**: Real-time attendance tracking with pattern detection algorithms
- **QR Code Service**: Dynamic generation with configurable expiration and security tokens
- **Notification Service**: SMS/email delivery with 30-minute SLA for absence alerts
- **Integration Service**: SIS synchronization with major platforms (PowerSchool, Infinite Campus)

### Infrastructure
- **Database Schema**: Optimized PostgreSQL tables for attendance, users, classes with proper indexing
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management, real-time data, and QR code validation
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting, request validation, and external integration management
- **Background Jobs**: Async notification delivery, pattern analysis, and report generation
- **CDN Integration**: Static asset delivery and QR code image caching

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Mobile Experience (Weeks 1-3)
- Set up FastAPI project with async database connections
- Implement Next.js PWA with shadcn/ui component system
- Build instant class creation workflow with QR code generation
- Develop student join methods (QR/link/code) with real-time feedback

### Phase 2: Attendance & Real-time Features (Weeks 4-5)
- Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Build student self-check-in workflow with state management
- Add teacher override and bulk attendance operations
- Implement basic reporting and analytics

### Phase 3: Integration & Production (Weeks 6-8)
- SIS integration development and testing
- FERPA compliance implementation and security audit
- Performance optimization for 1000+ concurrent users
- Production deployment and monitoring setup

- **Compliance Documentation**: FERPA policy review and data handling procedures

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Class Creation Speed**: <15 seconds from tap to active QR code display
- **Join Success Rate**: >98% successful student joins across all methods (QR/link/code)
- **Attendance Completion**: <30 seconds total time for full class attendance
- **Mobile Performance**: <2s load time on 3G networks, <1s on WiFi
- **Real-time Updates**: <500ms latency for live join monitoring and attendance updates

### Quality Gates
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: 100% feature parity on iOS Safari, Chrome Android, desktop browsers
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification via automated and manual testing
- **Security Standards**: FERPA compliance audit and penetration testing approval
- **Offline Functionality**: Core attendance features working without internet connection
- **Scalability Validation**: Load testing with 1000+ concurrent users successfully completed

### Acceptance Criteria
- Teachers can create and share classes in real classroom settings within time targets
- Students can join via any method (QR/link/code) with >98% success rate on first attempt
- Attendance data synchronizes with existing SIS systems without data loss
- System maintains 99.9% uptime during school operational hours
- All user interactions optimized for mobile devices with touch-friendly interfaces

## Estimated Effort

### Overall Timeline: 8 Weeks
- **Development**: 6 weeks (2 developers)
