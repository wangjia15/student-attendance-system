- **Security Framework**: Uses existing authentication and encryption

## Next Steps

Stream D is complete and ready for production deployment. The implementation provides:

1. **Immediate Value**: Enhanced notification capabilities available immediately
2. **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth to millions of notifications
3. **Compliance**: GDPR-ready audit trails and data protection
4. **Flexibility**: Easy addition of new providers and notification types
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
