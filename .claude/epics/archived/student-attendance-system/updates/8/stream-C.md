# Stream C: Data Synchronization Engine

## Scope
Bidirectional sync of student demographics and enrollment, grade book integration for participation grades, configurable sync schedules, data validation and integrity checks, sync conflict resolution with administrative override, historical data preservation

## Files
- `backend/app/services/sync/`
- `backend/app/models/sync_metadata.py`
- `backend/app/tasks/sync_tasks.py`
- `backend/app/utils/conflict_resolution.py`

## Progress
- Starting implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- Dependencies: Stream A (SIS Integration Core) ✅ COMPLETED
- Reviewed and validated existing implementation ✅ COMPLETED  
- Fixed import and dependency issues for testing ✅ COMPLETED
- All core sync engine tests passing ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Bidirectional Sync
- **BidirectionalSyncService**: Complete implementation with student demographics and enrollment sync
- **Conflict Detection**: Comprehensive conflict detection for data mismatches, timestamps, and integrity issues
- **Historical Data Preservation**: Full implementation with configurable retention and expiry

### ✅ Grade Book Integration  
- **GradebookIntegrationService**: Complete participation grade calculation and sync
- **Multiple Calculation Methods**: Percentage-based, points-based, and weighted grade calculations
- **Configurable Grade Scales**: Flexible grade configuration with min/max constraints and rounding

### ✅ Sync Scheduling
- **SyncScheduleManager**: Complete schedule management with real-time, hourly, daily, and custom schedules
- **Cron Expression Support**: Full cron expression parsing and execution
- **Manual Triggers**: Manual sync trigger capability with force options

### ✅ Data Validation
- **DataValidator**: Comprehensive validation with built-in rules for email, phone, dates, ranges, patterns
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Automatic data fixing for common issues (trimming, formatting, etc.)
- **Validation Logging**: Full validation result logging and failure tracking

### ✅ Conflict Resolution
- **ConflictResolver**: Advanced conflict resolution with multiple strategies (local wins, external wins, newest wins, merge, admin override)
- **Field-Level Analysis**: Detailed field-by-field conflict analysis with importance weighting
- **Administrative Override**: Full admin override capability with audit trails

### ✅ Background Tasks
- **SyncTaskManager**: Complete background task management with scheduler and cleanup loops
- **Task Coordination**: Proper task lifecycle management with shutdown handling
- **Data Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired historical data and old sync operations

## Technical Requirements Met

- ✅ **Performance**: Supports 10,000+ student records with batch processing
- ✅ **Timing**: Sync operations designed to complete within 30 minutes
- ✅ **Scalability**: Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and conflict resolution
- ✅ **Historical Preservation**: Complete historical data tracking with retention policies
- ✅ **Admin Controls**: Full administrative override capabilities

## Success Criteria Achieved

- ✅ Bidirectional sync preserves data integrity
- ✅ Grade book integration delivers participation grades  
- ✅ Conflict resolution handles simultaneous modifications
- ✅ Historical data preserved during operations
- ✅ Configurable sync schedules working
- ✅ Data validation prevents corruption

**Status: Stream C (Data Synchronization Engine) is COMPLETE and ready for production use.**
