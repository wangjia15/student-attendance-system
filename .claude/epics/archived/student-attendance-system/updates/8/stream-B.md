10. **FastAPI Integration** - Middleware for request interception

### ✅ Technical Requirements Met

#### Rate Limiting & Throttling
- ✅ Provider-specific rate limits (PowerSchool: 1000/hour, Infinite Campus: 500/hour, Skyward: 2000/hour)
- ✅ Token bucket algorithm for smooth request distribution
- ✅ Request queuing with configurable timeouts
- ✅ Adaptive throttling based on server responses
- ✅ Burst handling with configurable burst limits

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- ✅ Automatic failure detection with configurable thresholds
- ✅ State management (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED)
- ✅ Recovery timeout with exponential backoff
- ✅ Manual override capabilities for administrative control
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics and monitoring

#### API Key Management
- ✅ Secure encrypted storage of API keys
- ✅ Automatic key rotation with configurable intervals
- ✅ Multi-key support (primary, secondary, backup)
- ✅ Usage tracking and analytics
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

#### Request Routing
- ✅ Provider-aware routing with path pattern matching
- ✅ Health-based endpoint selection
- ✅ Multiple routing strategies (round-robin, weighted, least connections)
- ✅ Automatic failover to healthy endpoints
- ✅ Load balancing across multiple endpoints

#### Monitoring & Observability
- ✅ Real-time metrics collection and aggregation
- ✅ Comprehensive logging with error pattern detection
- ✅ Automated alerting based on configurable rules
- ✅ Dashboard data for operational visibility
- ✅ Performance monitoring and SLA tracking

#### Integration & Middleware
- ✅ FastAPI middleware for transparent request interception

- ✅ Header-based priority and timeout configuration
- ✅ Health check and admin endpoints
- ✅ Request/response transformation

### ✅ Success Criteria Achieved

- [x] **API gateway handles expected load** - Implemented with configurable processor pools and queue management
- [x] **Rate limiting respects SIS provider limits** - Provider-specific configurations with proper enforcement
- [x] **Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures** - Automatic failure detection with graceful degradation
- [x] **Comprehensive monitoring operational** - Full observability stack with metrics, logs, and alerts
- [x] **Request queuing and throttling working** - Advanced queuing with priority handling and adaptive throttling
