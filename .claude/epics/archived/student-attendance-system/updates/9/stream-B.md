- Automated threat response escalation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
- **SecurityAuditLog**: Immutable audit entries with SHA-256 integrity verification
- **SecurityIncident**: Incident tracking with automated response actions
- **LoginAttempt**: Failed login tracking for brute force detection
- **UserSession**: Active session monitoring and management

### Security Features Implemented
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: Cryptographic hash chains prevent tampering
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based alerting with configurable thresholds
- **Automated Response**: Rule-based incident response with IP blocking and account lockout
- **Granular RBAC**: 25+ permissions across 8 resource categories
- **MFA Support**: TOTP with backup codes and QR code generation
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based behavioral analysis with risk scoring
- **Comprehensive Middleware**: Multi-layer security controls and threat detection

### Integration Points
- **FERPA Compliance**: Coordinates with Stream A's compliance audit logging
- **Authentication System**: Extends existing auth with MFA and enhanced security
- **Database**: Integrates with existing models and relationships
- **API Security**: Middleware and decorators protect all endpoints

### Security Controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits per endpoint category
- **IP Blocking**: Automated and manual IP blacklisting
- **Session Management**: Timeout and hijacking protection
- **Threat Detection**: Pattern-based detection of common attacks
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic audit trail verification

## Performance and Scalability
- **Efficient Indexing**: Optimized database indexes for security queries
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking security monitoring tasks
- **Scalable Storage**: Supports high-volume audit logging
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second security event processing
