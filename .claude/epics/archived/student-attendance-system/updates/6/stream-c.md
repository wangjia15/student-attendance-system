## Integration Points

### Backend API Integration
- Complete integration with Stream A attendance endpoints
- Support for all attendance operations (check-in, status, history)
- Pattern analysis and alert system connectivity
- Teacher override capabilities (ready for Stream D)

### Component Architecture
- Modular, reusable components with clear interfaces
- Prop-based configuration for flexible usage
- Event-driven architecture with callback support
- Type-safe component interfaces

### State Management Integration
- Centralized state with distributed access patterns
- Custom hooks for selective state access
- Automatic state synchronization across components
- Persistent state management across browser sessions

## Configuration & Defaults

### WebSocket Configuration
```typescript
const wsManager = new AttendanceWebSocketManager();
// Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
// Maximum 5 reconnection attempts
// Base delay of 1 second with exponential increase
```

### Store Persistence
```typescript
// Selective persistence of critical data
partialize: (state) => ({
  myAttendance: state.myAttendance,
  currentSession: state.currentSession,
  offline: state.offline,
})
```

### Refresh Intervals
- Default class status refresh: 30 seconds
- WebSocket heartbeat: 30 seconds  
- Offline sync retry: 5 attempts with exponential backoff

## Performance Optimizations

### State Management
- Selective state subscriptions to minimize re-renders
- Custom selectors for specific data access
- Efficient state updates with Immer-like patterns
- Lazy loading of non-critical data

### Network Efficiency
- Request batching for multiple operations
- Intelligent caching of frequently accessed data
- Debounced validation to reduce API calls
