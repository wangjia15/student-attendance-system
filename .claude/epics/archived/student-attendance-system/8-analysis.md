# Issue #8 Analysis: SIS Integration & External APIs

## Parallel Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: SIS Integration Core
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None (uses existing auth from Task 2)
**Files:**
- `backend/app/integrations/sis/`
- `backend/app/services/sis_service.py`
- `backend/app/models/sis_integration.py`
- `backend/app/core/sis_config.py`

**Scope:**
- PowerSchool, Infinite Campus, and Skyward API integrations
- OAuth 2.0 and secure token management
- Plugin architecture for custom SIS configurations
- Real-time roster synchronization with conflict resolution
- Student enrollment/withdrawal handling

### Stream B: API Gateway & Rate Limiting
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** In parallel with Stream A
**Dependencies:** Basic backend setup (Task 2)
**Files:**
- `backend/app/gateway/`
- `backend/app/middleware/rate_limiting.py`
- `backend/app/services/api_gateway.py`
- `backend/app/core/circuit_breaker.py`

**Scope:**
- API gateway implementation with request routing
- Rate limiting per SIS provider
- Request queuing and throttling mechanisms
- API key management and rotation
- Circuit breaker pattern for external API failures
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Stream C: Data Synchronization Engine
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream A (needs SIS integrations)
**Dependencies:** Stream A SIS integration modules
**Files:**
- `backend/app/services/sync/`
- `backend/app/models/sync_metadata.py`
- `backend/app/tasks/sync_tasks.py`
- `backend/app/utils/conflict_resolution.py`

**Scope:**
- Bidirectional sync of student demographics and enrollment
- Grade book integration for participation grades
- Configurable sync schedules (real-time, hourly, daily)
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Sync conflict resolution with administrative override
- Historical data preservation

### Stream D: External Notification Services
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** In parallel with other streams
**Dependencies:** Basic backend setup (Task 2)
**Files:**
- `backend/app/services/notifications/`
- `backend/app/integrations/sms/`
- `backend/app/integrations/email/`
- `backend/app/models/notification_preferences.py`

**Scope:**
- SMS notification integration (Twilio, AWS SNS)
- Email notification service with template management
- Parent/guardian notification preferences
- Bulk notification capabilities with rate limiting
- Delivery status tracking and retry mechanisms
- Notification audit trails

## Coordination Requirements

### Stream Dependencies
- **C depends on A:** Data sync needs SIS integration modules
- **B can enhance A:** Rate limiting improves SIS API reliability
- **D is independent:** Can work parallel to all streams

### Shared Resources
- **Database schemas:** Coordinate SIS metadata and sync tables
- **API configurations:** Share SIS endpoint configurations
- **Error handling:** Consistent error patterns across streams
- **Authentication:** Unified credential management

### Integration Points
- SIS authentication with existing user management (Task 2)
- Sync operations with attendance data (Task 6)
- Notification delivery with user preferences
- API gateway routing for all external services

## Technical Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **External API Rate Limits** - Stream B implements proper throttling
2. **Data Consistency During Sync** - Stream C implements conflict resolution
3. **SIS Downtime Handling** - Circuit breaker and graceful degradation
4. **Large Dataset Performance** - Batch processing and pagination

### Performance Targets
- Support 10,000+ student records (All streams)
- Sync operations within 30 minutes (Stream C)
- API response times <2s (Stream B)
- 99.9% uptime (All streams)

- [ ] Parent/guardian preferences respected
- [ ] Bulk notifications with proper rate limiting
- [ ] Delivery tracking and audit trails functional
