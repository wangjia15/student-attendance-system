## Description

Implement comprehensive Student Information System (SIS) integration with major platforms including PowerSchool, Infinite Campus, and Skyward. Establish robust two-way data synchronization for student rosters, grade book integration for participation grades, and external notification services.

## Acceptance Criteria

### SIS Integration
- [ ] PowerSchool API integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- [ ] Infinite Campus API integration with secure token management
- [ ] Skyward API integration with proper error handling
- [ ] Support for custom SIS configurations via plugin architecture
- [ ] Real-time roster synchronization with conflict resolution
- [ ] Automated student enrollment/withdrawal handling

### Data Synchronization
- [ ] Bidirectional sync of student demographics and enrollment data
- [ ] Grade book integration for attendance-based participation grades
- [ ] Configurable sync schedules (real-time, hourly, daily)
- [ ] Data validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Sync conflict resolution with administrative override
- [ ] Historical data preservation during sync operations

### API Gateway & Rate Limiting
- [ ] API gateway implementation with request routing
- [ ] Rate limiting per SIS provider (respecting their limits)
- [ ] Request queuing and throttling mechanisms
- [ ] API key management and rotation
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for external API failures

### External Notification Services
- [ ] SMS notification integration (Twilio, AWS SNS)
- [ ] Email notification service with template management
- [ ] Parent/guardian notification preferences
- [ ] Bulk notification capabilities with rate limiting
- [ ] Delivery status tracking and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Notification audit trails

### Error Handling & Resilience
- [ ] Graceful degradation when SIS is unavailable
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed sync operations
- [ ] Administrative alerts for sync failures
- [ ] Data consistency validation and repair tools

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Architecture
- RESTful API clients for each SIS platform
- Webhook endpoints for real-time notifications
- Message queue system for async processing
- Database schemas for sync metadata tracking

### Security Requirements
- Encrypted credential storage
- API key rotation and management
- Audit logging for all external API calls
- Data encryption in transit and at rest

### Performance Requirements
- Support for 10,000+ student records
- Sync operations complete within 30 minutes
- API response times under 2 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for integration services

## Dependencies
- Task 2: Core authentication and user management must be complete
- Task 6: Reporting infrastructure required for sync status reporting

## Deliverables
1. SIS integration modules for PowerSchool, Infinite Campus, Skyward
2. API gateway with rate limiting and monitoring
3. Data synchronization engine with conflict resolution
4. External notification service implementations
5. Integration testing suite with mock SIS responses
6. Administrative dashboard for sync management
7. Documentation for SIS configuration and troubleshooting

## Definition of Done
- All SIS integrations tested with sandbox environments
- Data sync operations validated with test datasets
- API gateway handles expected load with proper rate limiting
- External notifications delivered successfully
- Integration monitoring and alerting operational
- Administrative tools for sync management available
- Code reviewed and security validated
