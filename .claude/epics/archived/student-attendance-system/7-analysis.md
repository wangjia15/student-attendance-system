# Issue #7 Analysis: Real-time Features & WebSocket Implementation

## Parallel Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: WebSocket Infrastructure (Backend)
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Dependencies:** None (uses existing auth from Task 2/6)
**Files:**
- `backend/app/websocket/`
- `backend/app/core/websocket.py`
- `backend/requirements.txt`
- `backend/app/main.py`

**Scope:**
- WebSocket server setup with Socket.IO/FastAPI WebSocket
- Connection authentication and authorization middleware
- Message routing and event handling system
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Health monitoring and metrics collection

### Stream B: Real-time Frontend Integration
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream A (needs WebSocket endpoints)
**Dependencies:** Stream A WebSocket infrastructure
**Files:**
- `frontend/src/services/websocket.ts`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtime.ts`
- `frontend/src/store/realtime/`
- `frontend/src/components/*/` (dashboard updates)

**Scope:**
- WebSocket client connection management
- Real-time state management integration
- Dashboard live updates for attendance
- Live student join monitoring UI
- Connection status indicators

### Stream C: Push Notification System
**Agent Type:** general-purpose  
**Can Start:** In parallel with Stream A
**Dependencies:** Basic backend setup (Task 2)
**Files:**
- `backend/app/services/notifications/`
- `frontend/src/services/notifications.ts`
- `backend/app/models/notifications.py`
- Service worker files for web push

**Scope:**
- Push notification service setup (FCM, Web Push)
- Notification preferences management
- Cross-platform notification delivery
- Notification batching and queuing
- Rich notification content with actions

### Stream D: Offline Sync & Conflict Resolution
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream A & B foundation
**Dependencies:** WebSocket infrastructure, real-time state management
**Files:**
- `frontend/src/services/offline/`
- `frontend/src/store/sync/`
- `backend/app/services/sync/`
- `frontend/src/utils/conflict-resolution.ts`

**Scope:**
- Offline-first data caching strategy
- Sync queue management and processing  
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Network state monitoring
- Progressive sync with bandwidth optimization

## Coordination Requirements

### Stream Dependencies
- **B depends on A:** Frontend needs WebSocket endpoints and event schemas
- **D depends on A+B:** Offline sync needs real-time infrastructure established

### Shared Resources
- **Database schemas:** Coordinate event logging and notification tables
- **API contracts:** WebSocket event types and message formats
- **State management:** Ensure consistent real-time state patterns

### Integration Points
- WebSocket authentication with existing user sessions (Task 2)
- Real-time updates for attendance data (Task 6)
- Frontend state consistency across all real-time features
- Performance monitoring across all streams

## Technical Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **WebSocket Connection Overload** - Stream A implements throttling
2. **Real-time Data Consistency** - Coordinate event ordering between streams
3. **Memory Leaks** - All streams implement proper cleanup
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility** - Stream C tests across all platforms

### Performance Targets
- WebSocket latency: <100ms (Stream A)
- UI update responsiveness: <200ms (Stream B)  
- Notification delivery: <5s (Stream C)
- Sync completion: <30s (Stream D)

## Success Criteria Per Stream

### Stream A Success
- [ ] 1000+ concurrent WebSocket connections

- [ ] Live student join monitoring
- [ ] Consistent state across teacher sessions
- [ ] Offline indicators functional

### Stream C Success
- [ ] Cross-platform notifications working
- [ ] Notification batching prevents spam
- [ ] Rich notifications with actions
- [ ] Offline notification queuing

### Stream D Success
- [ ] Full offline attendance workflow
- [ ] Conflict resolution without corruption
- [ ] Bandwidth-optimized sync
- [ ] Clear offline/online status
