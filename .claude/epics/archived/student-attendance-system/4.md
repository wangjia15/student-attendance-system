# Task: Instant Class Creation System

## Overview

Develop a mobile-optimized class creation system that enables teachers to create attendance sessions in under 15 seconds. The system generates secure QR codes, shareable links with deep linking support, and 6-digit verification codes. Includes a real-time monitoring interface for tracking student joins and attendance status.

## Technical Requirements

### Mobile-Optimized Class Creation UI
- Progressive Web App (PWA) interface with offline capability and app-like experience
- Single-tap class creation with pre-filled templates and smart defaults
- Form auto-completion using previous class data and teacher preferences
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices with touch-friendly controls
- Real-time validation with instant feedback on form inputs

### QR Code Generation with Security
- Secure QR code generation using JWT tokens with class-specific claims
- Time-based expiration tokens (configurable 5-60 minutes) with automatic refresh
- Unique session identifiers preventing replay attacks and unauthorized access
- QR code regeneration capability for extended sessions or security concerns
- High-contrast QR codes optimized for various lighting conditions and display sizes

### Shareable Link Generation
- Deep linking support for native mobile apps and web browsers
- Universal links (iOS) and App Links (Android) for seamless app opening
- Fallback web interface when native apps are not installed
- Social sharing integration with WhatsApp, email, and SMS
- Link customization with school branding and class information

### 6-Digit Verification Code System
- Algorithm-generated 6-digit codes with collision avoidance
- Code expiration synchronization with QR code and link tokens
- Accessibility support with large fonts and screen reader compatibility
- Manual code entry interface with auto-advancement and error correction
- Code regeneration with teacher notification and student updates

### Real-Time Class Join Monitoring
- WebSocket-based live updates showing student join status and timestamps
- Visual attendance dashboard with student photos and join confirmation
- Attendance statistics with real-time counts and participation metrics
- Export functionality for attendance records in multiple formats (CSV, PDF)
- Integration with school information systems and gradebook platforms

## Acceptance Criteria

### Class Creation Performance
- [ ] Class creation completed in <15 seconds from app launch to active session

- [ ] Token expiration configurable from 5-60 minutes with default 30 minutes
- [ ] QR codes readable by standard camera apps and custom attendance scanners
- [ ] Code regeneration updates all active student sessions within 5 seconds
- [ ] Security validation prevents code reuse after expiration or session end

### Link Sharing & Deep Linking
- [ ] Deep links open native app when installed, fallback to web interface
- [ ] Universal links and App Links properly configured and tested on devices
- [ ] Social sharing generates rich previews with class information and school branding
- [ ] Link sharing works across email, SMS, messaging apps, and QR codes
- [ ] Fallback web interface provides full attendance functionality

### Verification Code System
- [ ] 6-digit codes generated using secure algorithm with collision detection
- [ ] Code expiration synchronized with QR code and link token lifecycles
- [ ] Manual entry interface supports accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Auto-advancement between code digit inputs with backspace correction
- [ ] Code regeneration notifies teacher and updates all active student sessions

### Real-Time Monitoring Interface
- [ ] WebSocket connections maintain stable real-time updates with <1 second latency
- [ ] Student join notifications appear instantly with visual and audio feedback
- [ ] Attendance dashboard shows student photos, names, and join timestamps
- [ ] Live statistics update showing total students, joined count, and participation rate
- [ ] Session management allows teacher to end session and generate final reports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Core components that must be implemented
- ClassCreationForm (mobile-optimized form with templates)
- QRCodeGenerator (security token integration)
- ShareLinkManager (deep linking and social sharing)
- VerificationCodeDisplay (accessibility optimized)
- AttendanceDashboard (real-time WebSocket updates)
```

### API Endpoints
```python
# Essential endpoints that must be created
- POST /classes/create (create new attendance session)
- POST /classes/{class_id}/qr-code/regenerate
- GET /classes/{class_id}/share-link
- POST /classes/{class_id}/verification-code/regenerate
- WebSocket /classes/{class_id}/live-updates
```

### Security Implementation
```python
# Security features that must be implemented
- JWT token generation with class-specific claims and expiration
- Rate limiting on class creation and code regeneration
- Session validation and cleanup for expired codes
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
- Input validation and sanitization for all form inputs
```

## Testing Requirements
