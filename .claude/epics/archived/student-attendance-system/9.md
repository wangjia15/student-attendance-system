## Description

Implement comprehensive security measures, FERPA compliance framework, and conduct extensive performance testing to ensure the system can handle 1000+ concurrent users while maintaining data privacy and security standards required for educational environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

### FERPA Compliance Implementation
- [ ] Data privacy controls for student educational records
- [ ] Consent management system for data sharing
- [ ] Data retention policies with automated purging
- [ ] Access logging for all student data interactions
- [ ] Data anonymization tools for reporting
- [ ] Compliance reporting dashboard
- [ ] Staff training materials for FERPA requirements

### Security Audit Trails
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging for all user actions
- [ ] Immutable audit trail storage with integrity verification
- [ ] Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Failed login attempt tracking and lockout mechanisms
- [ ] Data access patterns analysis for anomaly detection
- [ ] Security incident response automation

### Access Controls & Authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts
- [ ] Session management with automatic timeout
- [ ] IP whitelisting and geo-blocking capabilities
- [ ] API authentication and authorization
- [ ] Privileged access management (PAM) for system administrators

### Performance Testing (1000+ Concurrent Users)
- [ ] Load testing scenarios with realistic user patterns
- [ ] Stress testing to identify breaking points
- [ ] Endurance testing for extended operation periods
- [ ] Database performance optimization and indexing
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation and validation
- [ ] CDN configuration for static assets

### Cross-Platform Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Responsive design testing across devices

- [ ] Offline functionality validation
- [ ] Touch interface usability testing
- [ ] Network connectivity resilience testing
- [ ] Battery usage optimization

### Scalability Validation
- [ ] Horizontal scaling configuration and testing
- [ ] Database sharding and replication setup
- [ ] Load balancer configuration and failover testing
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies and thresholds
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Capacity planning documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Security Infrastructure
