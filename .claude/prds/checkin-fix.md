# PRD: Check-in Fix

## Executive Summary

This PRD addresses critical issues in the student attendance system where teachers cannot see real-time attendance status, students face problems joining classes via verification codes, and the teacher dashboard fails to display accurate student enrollment data. The solution involves fixing WebSocket real-time updates, clarifying the student enrollment workflow, and implementing comprehensive end-to-end testing with Playwright.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The current attendance system has four critical issues:
1. **Teacher Interface Missing Data**: Teachers cannot see which students are present/absent for current sessions
2. **No Real-time Updates**: Attendance data remains static, requiring manual refreshes
3. **Broken Verification Code Flow**: Students cannot successfully join classes using verification codes
4. **Incomplete Student Lists**: Teacher class lists don't show enrolled students properly

### Why is this important now?
- Teachers need real-time visibility for accurate attendance tracking during live classes
- Students are frustrated with failed class joining attempts
- The system undermines trust in the attendance tracking functionality
- Manual workarounds are creating operational inefficiencies

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Teacher (Primary)**
- Needs to see real-time attendance during class sessions
- Wants to verify student enrollment in their classes
- Requires accurate attendance reporting capabilities

**Student (Secondary)**
- Needs to join classes using verification codes
- Wants to check into classes successfully
- Expects immediate confirmation of attendance status

### Detailed User Journeys

#### Teacher Journey: Real-time Attendance Monitoring
```
1. Teacher opens AttendanceDashboard for active class session
2. System displays enrolled students with "Not Yet Checked In" status
3. As students check in, their status updates to "Present" in real-time
4. Teacher can see live count of Present/Absent students
5. Teacher receives visual notifications for new check-ins
```

#### Student Journey: Class Joining and Check-in
```
1. Student enters verification code on StudentDashboard
2. System validates code and enrolls student in class
3. Student immediately sees class in their "My Classes" list
4. Student clicks "Check In" for daily attendance
5. System confirms check-in and updates teacher's dashboard
```

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- **Static Data**: Teachers see outdated attendance information
- **Unclear Enrollment**: Students don't know if they successfully joined classes
- **Missing Real-time Feedback**: No immediate confirmation of actions
- **Workflow Confusion**: Enrollment vs. daily check-in processes are conflated

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
1. **Real-time Update Latency**: 95% of attendance updates appear within 2 seconds
2. **Verification Code Success Rate**: 98% of valid codes result in successful enrollment
3. **Data Accuracy**: 100% of enrolled students appear in teacher dashboards
4. **WebSocket Reliability**: 99% uptime for real-time connections during class hours

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Teacher dashboard load time < 3 seconds
- Student enrollment success rate > 95%
- Real-time update delivery rate > 98%
- User-reported issues reduced by 90%

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Limitations
- Must maintain compatibility with existing SQLite database schema
- WebSocket implementation must work with current FastAPI/React architecture
- Mobile-first design constraints must be preserved

### Timeline Constraints
- Critical fixes needed for next academic session
- Must not disrupt existing user workflows during implementation
- Requires comprehensive testing before deployment

### Resource Limitations
- Single developer team
- Must reuse existing UI components where possible
- Limited time for major architectural changes

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- WebSocket library compatibility with current tech stack
- Browser WebSocket support for target devices
- Database migration capabilities for any schema changes

### Internal Team Dependencies
- Frontend team for React component updates
- Backend team for API and WebSocket implementation
- QA team for comprehensive Playwright test coverage

- Offline attendance tracking capabilities

### Future Considerations
- Machine learning for attendance pattern analysis
- Integration with calendar systems
- Advanced teacher administrative tools
- Student attendance goal tracking

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Backend Changes Required
1. **Fix WebSocket Integration**: Connect attendance API routes with WebSocket broadcasts
2. **Separate Enrollment API**: Create distinct endpoints for joining classes vs. daily check-in
3. **Real-time Attendance Updates**: Implement WebSocket events for attendance state changes

## Testing Strategy

### Playwright End-to-End Testing
1. **Complete Enrollment Flow**: Student joins class → appears in teacher list
2. **Real-time Check-in**: Student checks in → teacher dashboard updates immediately
3. **Error Scenarios**: Invalid verification codes, network failures, concurrent users
4. **WebSocket Reliability**: Connection drops, reconnection, bulk updates
5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari on desktop and mobile
