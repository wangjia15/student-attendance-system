# PRD: Student Attendance System

## Executive Summary

The Student Attendance System is a mobile-first digital solution designed to modernize attendance tracking for educational institutions. Built with FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend using shadcn/ui components, the system enables teachers to create classes face-to-face and allows students to join via QR codes, shareable links, or verification codes. The platform provides real-time visibility, automated notifications, and comprehensive analytics.

**Value Proposition:** Reduce attendance-taking time to <30 seconds per class, achieve 99.9% accuracy through digital methods, and enable seamless class setup and student onboarding with multiple join options while maintaining full data privacy compliance.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
Educational institutions face significant challenges with traditional attendance systems:

- **Manual Inefficiency**: Paper-based roll calls consume 5-10 minutes per class, totaling 2-3 hours per teacher daily
- **Data Accuracy Issues**: Human error in manual entry leads to 15-20% discrepancy rates in attendance records
- **Limited Visibility**: Parents, administrators, and students lack real-time access to attendance data
- **Compliance Challenges**: Difficulty maintaining audit trails and meeting regulatory reporting requirements
- **Administrative Burden**: Hours spent weekly consolidating attendance reports across classes and departments

### Why This Matters Now
- **Mobile-First Education**: Teachers and students expect mobile-optimized solutions for classroom management
- **Instant Class Setup**: Need for rapid, face-to-face class creation without administrative delays
- **Flexible Student Onboarding**: Multiple join methods accommodate different technical comfort levels and scenarios
- **Real-time Engagement**: Modern users expect instant feedback and seamless digital interactions
- **Resource Optimization**: Schools need to maximize teaching time and minimize administrative overhead
